E-learning statistics (DRAFT)

This repository contains files that are used for high-school statistics course (grades 7-8 and 10-11 in Latvia; i.e. ages 14-15 and 17-18). Materials are mostly in Latvian, but some other languages may also be present.

So far the material is not ready for external use (it is an early draft). Whenever it matures, you will see normal release numbers and setup/use instructions in this README.md file. 

Kind Regards, 
Kalvis Apsitis and other developers.
